### Features
Multiplayer lobbies — Host or join a session with up to 16 players using a 6-character code. The host controls difficulty, enemy count, friendly fire, and more.
Persistent progression — Your money carries across every session. Earn cash by shooting down enemies, spend it in the Hangar between flights.
Fully modular aircraft — Swap fuselages, wings, engines, guns, missiles, bombs, and countermeasures. Every combination changes how your plane handles and fights.
Deep weapon variety — From a starter 7.62mm machine gun to a $2.5M tactical nuke. Guns, IR missiles, radar missiles, rocket pods, iron bombs, and a recoilless rifle.
Infinite procedural world — Terrain, rivers, mountains, forests, and plains generate endlessly in every direction. Every lobby gets a unique world seed.
No models, no textures — Every visual is built in code. Aircraft, terrain, explosions, smoke, and sky are all generated with geometry and shaders at runtime, keeping the game fast-loading.
Realistic lighting & atmosphere — Rayleigh/Mie sky scattering, a live day/night cycle, volumetric clouds, bloom, ambient occlusion, and heat haze — all running in the browser.
Smart AI enemies — Seven enemy tiers from Scout to Ace Pilot, each with their own weapons, tactics, and cash reward. Difficulty scales their accuracy and reaction time.
Consequential economy — Landing costs a small repair fee. Crashing costs 1.5× the value of the enemy that killed you. Your wallet can go negative.
Gun lead indicator — A dynamic targeting reticle calculates where to aim based on bullet velocity, target speed, and range in real time.
Fully procedural audio — Every engine hum, gunshot, explosion, and missile tone is synthesised via the Web Audio API. Zero audio files downloaded.
Customisable settings — Adjust graphics quality, render distance, enemy spawn rate, control scheme (mouse or WASD), HUD scale, and more.
