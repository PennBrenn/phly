## 🔥 Combat Tips

### Missile Combat
- **Get behind enemies** for best lock-on angles
- **Hold Space** to engage seeker - watch the lock progress bar
- **Release when locked** - green means good lock, red means breaking
- **Use chaff** when you hear missile lock warnings

### Dogfighting
- **Use guns** (weapon 1) for close-range combat
- **Manage energy** - maintain speed for maneuverability
- **Watch your G-meter** - too many G's cause blackouts
- **Use afterburner** for quick escapes or attacks

### Ground Attack
- **Strafe tanks** with guns for precise strikes
- **Use missiles** on SAM sites from safe distance
- **Watch for AA fire** - ground targets shoot back!

### Survival
- **Stay in bounds** - OOB warning gives you time to return
- **Manage health** - land repairs aren't available in combat
- **Watch your six** - enemies love attacking from behind
